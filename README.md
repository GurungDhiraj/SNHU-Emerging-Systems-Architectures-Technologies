# SNHU-Emerging-Systems-Architectures-Technologies

## <ins>**Course Description:**<ins>

Students will explore emerging systems, architectures, and technologies. Students will be provided with an in-depth evaluation of emerging system architecture, focusing on performance and the software/hardware interface. Emphasis is on analyzing fundamental issues in architectural design and the impact on application performance to enable a better understanding of the concepts. Students will learn to evaluate software architectures, both established and emerging, and gain experience in determining when to implement architectures and technologies to fulfill business needs.

## <ins>**Course Competencies:**<ins>

This course covers the following competencies, which represent the knowledge and skills relevant to your field:

    •Write interface software to control hardware components
    •Analyze fundamental considerations regarding hardware architecture design and their impact on application performance
    •Recommend and justify emerging systems architectures and technologies based on business requirements


## <ins>**Project Description:**<ins>
The overall goal of the project was to create a prototype thermostat that utilized a sensor and an LCD display screen. The objective was to have 3 different states for the thermostat: heating, cooling, and off. The LCD screen would display the current temperature and the set temperature. It would then update based on button inputs to change the state of the device or temperature. The goal was to code a program that worked with a Raspberry Pi hooked up to sensors to accomplish this. Showing the displays on the LCD screens worked out quite well, and the button functionality worked as intended. Overall, I did meet all the requirements of this project. However, if I wanted to add more functionality to the thermostat, I think I should have created different files for each class I worked on so that the code was modular and easier to edit for the future if I wanted to add new features to the code.
Creating maintainable and readable code is important when working on projects, especially if you plan to work on them over a longer time period. This project was done over the course of several weeks, and so it was important to use comments effectively. Using comments allowed me to go back to previous code and more quickly understand the purpose of that line of code. I also kept a Word document of common commands and actions I needed to take to interact with the Raspberry Pi. This document was quite helpful as a tool that I could just refer to when I needed help or forgot how to do something. I added commands and information to the document as I worked on the project to take note of things I thought could be useful to remember.  
Working on this project was quite fun, and I learned a lot of different things. However, this project was not without its challenges. It was my first time working with embedded systems and using code to control a different device. There were a lot of times I had to use YouTube videos or online guides to help me understand how to code on the Raspberry Pi. This project had a lot of instructions that were not always clear or simple to follow, at least for me and my experience. However, I learned to reach out when I needed help and to just continue working on different solutions before giving up. Continuing to work on a problem even when I had no clue what I was doing was actually helpful. Even if I did not figure out the answer, it forced me to continue instead of just giving up, which shifted my mentality from “I can’t do this” to “What is something I can do to try and fix this?” This mentality shift was huge for me and really helped me push through even in times where I felt clueless, and is something that I will remember for other projects.
